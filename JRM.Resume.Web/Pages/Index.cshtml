            I'm a hobbiest game developer and professional Web and Data Visualization Developer based in Wisconsin.<br /><br />
            Since 2004 I've been living and breathing software development, progressively building and expanding my skillset. Creating everything from video games to distributed networking solutions and AR/VR marketing applications. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects in the last 17 years, helping to make this world a little better through design & code.
